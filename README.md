# GOV.UK Notify support handbook

Runs the Github pages hosted site at https://alphagov.github.io/notify-support/

## Editing content

Look at the markdown files in the `_content` folder. Each markdown file becomes a section of the site.

## Development

This is a static site generated with Jekyll.

To run it locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000`. As you make modifications, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
