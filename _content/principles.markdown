1. Be human

    You’re both people, working on delivering better government services. You just don’t sit at the same desk.

2. Show empathy

    This person is coming to you because they have a problem or are stuck. Show that you’ve read and understand what they’re saying.

3. Be helpful

    Answer the question they’re asking. If this doesn’t solve their problem, then offer alternatives that might. Don’t send out general information.

4. Have a conversation

    Write in the way you’d talk if you were helping this person over the phone. Make it feel like it’s not a big deal for them to follow up with more questions.    

5. Talk their language

    Use the same terminology as the person you’re talking to. Do the careful work of translating your message into their words, not vice versa.

6. Copy and paste with care

    Remove anything not specifically relevant to the person and question you’re replying to. Whatever you send should read and look like one message.

7. Don’t be pushy, don’t be salesy

    We increase adoption by understanding and meeting people’s needs, not by trying to create them.
