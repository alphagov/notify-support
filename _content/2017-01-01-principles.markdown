1. Be human

    You’re both people, working on delivering better government services. You just don’t sit at the same desk.

2. Be empathetic

    This person is coming to you because they have a problem or are stuck. Show that you’ve read and understand what they’re saying.

3. Be conversational

    Write how you would talk like you would if you were helping this person over the phone.

4. Answer the question they’re asking

    Don’t send out generic information. Make it feel like it’s not a big deal for them to ask if they still have other questions. If the answer is no, offer alternatives.

5. Use the words they use

    Don’t make people translate.

6. Copy and paste with care

    Remove anything not specifically relevant to the person and question you’re replying to. Whatever you send should read and look like one message.

7. Don’t be pushy, don’t be salesy

    We increase adoption by understanding and meeting people’s needs, not by trying to create them.
