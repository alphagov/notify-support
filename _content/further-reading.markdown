[Controlled vocabulary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yjvhiCV9vZF3M7ka9Vv4S4jhEkzSocr7BuZ8T96aB-A) talks about the names we give things.

In 2015 we ran a discovery. [Gov where’s my stuff](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/08/26/gov-wheres-my-stuff/) is from the start of discovery and  [Status tracking – making it easy to keep users informed](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2015/10/05/status-tracking-making-it-easy-to-keep-users-informed/) is from the end.

We sent our first messages in [July 2016](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/26/notify-sends-first-messages/).

In [March 2017](https://governmentasaplatform.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/01/notify-now-open-for-use/) we entered public beta for teams in central government.
