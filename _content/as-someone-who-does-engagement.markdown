Engagement managers don’t see every ticket. They should reply to all the ones they do see.

Reply to every ticket within a day, but much sooner if you can. Receiving a quick reply is a pleasant surprise for the person who’s asked the question.

If you decide to reply over the phone or by email, leave a note on the ticket afterwards. It’s useful for the Notify team to know the outcome of these conversations.

If there’s a ticket that you need help with, come down and see the Notify team, or ask a question on [GDS Slack](https://govuk.slack.com/messages/govuk-notify) (not cross-government Slack).
