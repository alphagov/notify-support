Engagement managers won’t see all the tickets that come in.

Every ticket should get a response within a day. People really appreciate a quick response though. You can’t be too quick.

If you take a conversation to another channel, leave a note on the ticket so that everyone else in Deskpro knows what’s up.

If there’s a ticket that you need help with, come down and see us, or ask a question on [GDS Slack](https://govuk.slack.com/messages/govuk-notify) (not cross-government Slack).
