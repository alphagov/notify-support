Developers see all tickets and decide whether or not a ticket is an emergency.

If a ticket is an emergency it needs a reply within 30 minutes, even if it’s just to say we’re aware of the problem. You might need to raise an incident too (the [process for incidents](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gz_hNbafNAN5CgSgit08PDEmUlPLaBziHkDevM3jOuM) is documented separately).

When you pick up a ticket, start drafting a reply straight away. Other people looking at the ticket will see your draft and know that you’ve got it covered.

If a ticket isn’t an emergency, or doesn’t need technical knowledge to answer then assign it to the ‘GOV.UK Notify product team’. You can still reply to these tickets if you want to. Questions get a reply within a day. Someone having a problem gets a reply within 2 hours.

Some problems happen because of a small bug, or unclear documentation. If there’s a quick and obvious fix which will stop the problem happening again, go ahead and make the change.

Some problems will take longer to fix, or could be addressed in a number of different ways. Have a discussion with the team before working on these. They might not be the highest priority, and we need to tell the user how long they should expect to wait.
