Developers see all tickets. They decide whether to reply to a ticket or triage it by assigning it to the ‘GOV.UK Notify product team’.

Triage a ticket if it isn’t an emergency, or isn’t a technical question about the API. Assign it to the ‘GOV.UK Notify product team’ if you don’t want to reply. You can still reply to these tickets if you want to.

Pick up a ticket by starting to type a reply. Other people will see your draft and know that you’re on it)

Any emergency needs a reply within 30 minutes, even if it’s just to say that you’re aware of the problem.

You have permission to make quick fixes, to the product or to documentation, if you think they would help.

If fixing the problem is a bigger piece of work, talk to someone about how much of a priority it is, so that expectations can be communicated back to the user.

Incidents are [documented separately](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gz_hNbafNAN5CgSgit08PDEmUlPLaBziHkDevM3jOuM).
