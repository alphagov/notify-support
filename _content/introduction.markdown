This document is for anyone who supports users (or potential users) of GOV.UK&nbsp;Notify.

Everyone on the Notify team can help with support, if they want to. The engagement team also answer questions about a whole department’s use of Notify, rather than one user’s.

Users come to us via our [support form](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) (which creates Deskpro tickets) and on [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/govuk-notify).

Support is about helping our users. But it also helps us: by looking for patterns, we can identify ways to improve the product, the guidance, and the service we offer.
