Everyone on the GOV.UK Notify team can help with support, if they want to. The engagement team also answer questions about a whole department’s use of Notify, rather than one user’s. This document is for anyone who replies to questions from Notify users.

Users come to us via our [support form](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) (which creates Deskpro tickets) and on [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/govuk-notify).

From 9:30am to 5:00pm we look at every message within 30 minutes and, if necessary, reply within this time.

Support is about helping our users. But it also helps us: by looking for patterns, we can identify ways to improve the product, the guidance, and the service we offer.
