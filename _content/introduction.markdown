This document is for anyone who supports users of GOV.UK Notify.

Everyone on the Notify team can help with support, if they want to. The engagement team also answer questions about onboarding to Notify, especially for services sending high volumes of messages.

Users come to us via our [support form](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) (which creates Zendesk tickets) and on [cross-government Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/messages/govuk-notify).

Support is about helping our users. But it also helps us: by looking for patterns, we can identify ways to improve the product, the guidance, and the service we offer.
