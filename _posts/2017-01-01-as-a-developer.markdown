- If you’re going to pick up a ticket, assign it to yourself so everyone knows you’re working on it.
- If the ticket doesn’t need a technical response and you don’t want to deal with it, change the team to the product team.
- You have permission to make quick fixes, to the product or to documentation, if you think they would help.
- If fixing the problem is a bigger piece of work, talk to someone about how much of a priority it is, so that expectations can be communicated back to the user.
- If someone is having a production issue then reply straight away.
- Incidents are documented separately.
