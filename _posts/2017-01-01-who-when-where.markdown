Everyone on the Notify team can help with support, if they want to. The GaaP engagement team also help with answering specific queries. This document is for both these groups of people, so consistency blah.

Users come to us via our [support form](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support) (which creates Deskpro tickets) and on cross-government Slack.

From 9:30am to 5:00pm we look at every message within 30 minutes and, if necessary, reply within this time.

Support is about helping our users. But it also helps us: by looking for patterns, we can identify ways to improve the product, the guidance, and the service we offer.
